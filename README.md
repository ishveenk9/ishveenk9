ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ishveen!
ðŸŽ“ Junior at Boston University, studying Computer Science
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software Engineer and Machine Learning Enthusiast

I have experience in building websites, leveraging VR, and machine learning. My work with different organizations has helped them streamline their efficiency and increase profits through creating new applications. Currently, I am a Machine Learning Fellow with Break Through Tech, diving into ML concepts through Cornellâ€™s coursework and I am soon applying them to industry challenges. I have previously interned at Liberty 53 District and OmniLifeVR, where I worked on everything from rebuilding websites to exploring how VR connects to real-world tech. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!
